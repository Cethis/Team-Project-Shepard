Pfwp Project for Cethis,459pm, and Shad-strater

This is our project for our programing class using Python. Mr. Rhema is our teacher, and assigned us to get this done by November 28. So far we are in the brainstorming phase of the project, and still trying to come up with what we wish to do.
So far we have come up with the idea, and including this in our extra credit assignment, to put a program inside a computer our teacher owns. (With his permision of course!)
