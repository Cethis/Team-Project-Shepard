Pfwp Project for Cethis,459pm, and Shad-strater

This is our project for our programing class using Python. Mr. Rhema is our teacher, and assigned us to get this done by December 5.Early in the class we coded a zombie survival game, using this as a base we will be making several new levels made of different layers of code.
We plan to call this game "Survival of the Last". The game itself will loosely contain 3-5 levels of play, made up of you running, shooting, and making the desicions that could save, or end your life. This is a collaboration of three different coders using their own code, and layering it together.
